In the lunch break, came home and watched this video on Hubble Telescope.

Our conceivable or observable Universe consists of around 200 billion galaxies.
Each galaxy can contain stars, stellar reminents, interstellar gas and dust.
Example of a star is Sun, the nearest to earth which forms our solar system. 
The solar system is a part of our milky way galaxy which itself contains around 400 billion stars.
The diameter of milky way galaxy is around 100,000 to 120,000 light years (1 light year is around 9 trillion kilometers)

My perspective of life completely changed after seeing all this. 
Who are we ? Are we alone ? How insignificant or significant earth can be ? 
May be, I don't even know what questions to ask at this point ?
What exactly is life ? Why is there a limit on the existence of a living being ?
Having seen the size of the universe, what questions one should have ? Where to go from here ?

If life is possible on earth, it can also be possible elsewhere.
