#One World

On Friday 13/11, I read some news about a terrorist attack in Paris. 129 people were killed.
I felt really bad about it. That's a different feeling altogether. I read some more.
After two hours, I found myself having a nice dinner with my friend. The next day, had party.
The next time I will have the same feeling of sympathy is when I hear a similar kind of news in the future.
Yes, I am going to hear it again. 
(And the best part is I don't have an inch of doubt in my mind that I can become a victim next time. I swear.)
I could have done something about it. But, I feel like I am very small to deal with it.
So, I leave it to the big heads.
But I know I could have atleast thought about it. After all, it's taking people's lives. 
What if I can sit for 10 mins and think if I can really do anything to help the situation.
I won't. May be becuase France is not my country afterall. 
But on 26/11, 2008 it happened in India. I did the same.
May be because Mumbai is not in my state in India.
I doubt if I will react in any way even if it is in my state.
It is being stupid of me to leave my duty of taking care of me and my family and to think about such stuff. 
I will react when it hits me or my family or atleast my community. 
Oh wait, may be not. Because I doubt if I will survive or I may not have any strength in me to fight in such situation.
But if it is for others, my answer is very clear. 
"Sorry. I simply cannot spare any time on this".
Because,I long forgot that we all at one point of time in history lived as one group. One human race.
Then over the time, this human race has given birth to other small groups.
Someone have to take me to a different planet and only then I will come back to my senses and answer "I am Human" to the question of "Who Am I ?"
Or may be some one from a different planet who is much stronger than us has to wage a war on earth and we will fight
them as one human race. 
But for now, I identify myself with groups. Be it my family, my community, my state or my country. Groups. 

#Why Groups ?
Groupism (Social stratification or categorization) is a very good tool for development.
Socieites in the early days were divided to create better organizing capabilities for themselves. 
Small groups are easy to manage. 
But while we identified ourselves with our groups and worked for the betterment of them, we forgot or ignored the bigger picture. 
Slowly like a poison, this ignorance lead us to take pride in our possessions and this disease of pride made us forget our roots.
It is this pride that caused error. We started thinking we are different from one another. 
While we have to help the people in our communities and others when they are in need, 
we focussed on becoming more rich (rich in money) and defined this state of domination as our success 
while in reality we are becoming poor in love and compassion, the defining charecteristics of a human being.
We are not successful if we are failing as a society.
Here I am not saying we should not make more money or that we should distribute all your hard earned money to the poor.
My point is while we do that, we should not be blind of the fact that there are people around us
who are deprived of basic human needs. We cannot go ignoring this anymore and we must do something about it.
Because this ongoing habit of ours to ignore the idea of equality has become the cause of seeking domination and 
suppression of the weak.
This suppressed group waited for a long time having deprived of 
basic human needs like educaiton, health and food. This hunger and poverty when reached to a certain threshhold, 
overtook reason and made our brothers to kill us. Who is the reason behind this ?

#War against Terrorism

Let's assume a person is diagnosed with cancer. (Cancer causes abnormal cell growth)
What he did is he chopped off the tumor. The result is, it will grow again.
Terrorism is just like cancer to human race. 
If you think you can cure it with chopping it off, it wont.
Looking at the intensity of the disaster, it appears as if war is the only solution. But not.
War against terrorism is like "killing to stop killing" which is nothing but absurd.
Unfortunately the real solution for this problem cannot be achieved in short time just because the virus that
caused the disease has a very long incubation period. 
But, if we think we really want to solve this, we can start working on this. 
And the effort we need to put into this is very small.
The solution is to work on prevention.
By which I mean, while we embrace the idea of groupism we will equally embrace the idea of oneness.
We will be able to see that they are our innocent brothers and sisters who died.
They must have had same kind of aspirations and hopes about their future. 
They must have had same kind of families at home waiting for them.

#How Can I Help ?

If we wage a war on terrorism, we will infect this disease to the next generation as their kids will grow up seeking revenge.
Instead if we see them as equals and work mutually to help one another, our societies will prosper as one.
There are two things here. 
1. Treat or Cure the disease (What can we do about the current situation ?)- On an individual level, it is very less that you can do to cure. 
What you can do is to embrace the idea of equality and show it in your day to day actions.
We are not going to overlook the problems our brothers and sisters are facing around the world. 
While we spare our little amount of time in thinking about how we can help our people in far off lands, we can spend 
our little energies in helping the deprived ones in our neighborhoods.
On a national level, implementing proper security measures to protect people is one solution.
2. Preventing the disease (What can we do about the future ?) - This is the part that is really in our hands. 
Preventing the next generation of kids from getting infected by this disease.
While embracing the idea of oneness for ourselves, we can become the vehicle for change by carrying this idea to our kids and neighbors.
And dont forget that it's only when we demonstrate it so strong(making it a top priority) through our action and dialogue, it can reach to the future generations.

Pledge #IAmHuman and say that even if you are a part of a group, a state or a nation,
you will never forget that you are in the end a human being and if you feel you are stronger you will utilize that strength
to protect and help the weak but not to watch them suffer or to exploit them. 
"Love" is the cure. And "to love" is to prevent.
