As I see the news of Paris being attacked by terrorists, I feel like why we were not able to do anything about it.
First I thought of waging a war against these people and eradicating them completely forever.
Then a thought came to my mind. What if their children think of us as their enemies and wage a war ?
So, while we were thinking to end this, we are sowing seeds for it to grow.
Then, what might be the solution for this problem ?
Well, it's like if we have a cancer causing tumor in our body, chopping of the tumor won't help you in anyway
coz it will again come back in multitudes. War is just the same.
Like any disease that kills us is caused by certain habits of our own, terrorism is a cultural disease caused 
by the habit of social stratification or categorisation.
What is not in our hands is a solution that can magically stop people from doing this right now.
Becuase it has a long incubation that made it so strong and a mere realization from your end that it is not right is 
not going to help us in any way.

The idea of groupism longs back to thousands of years.
It must have grown in the same way how we connect us to this world. 
Starting from a family to a community to a state to a country to a planet.
Why is there a planet ? Because when man starts colonization of other planets, he starts identifying him with his planet.
And then he judges the people of earth saying " the people of earth are less cultured and polluted "and stuff like that 
forgetting he once came from it.
We are behaving the same way.
It's us who are causing this problem. 
We are accustomed to identify ourselves with groups. 
One say I am an Indian the other say I am American. When the Indian is in India, he will say I am a Tamilian or I am a Telugu.
When he is in his state, he will say he is a Reddy or he is a Kapu.
When he is in his community, he will say he is from the family of Gidde. 
God, these many names. Who is he really ? He is what he thinks he is.
But if you can zoom out to the maximum known factor, he is a human being representing the human culture.
His actions define what a human is. 
We might be evolved becuase of our brains or brains might have evolved with our actions. Or the both. We don't know.

If there's no idea of groupism, it becomes really hard for organizing and managing ourselves.
Things become easy and contollable if they are small. 
A person when identified with a group be it a family or a community or a country, he will play by the rules and rituals of the group.
These rituals become the culture it represents. If you are present but you don't act in accordance with a group, you are not cultured.
Even our work will directly benefit the group we are associated with.
Then pride comes into play and seeks for domination and suppression.
The problem is created when we start identifying with the group and try to dominate or suppress others.
It means that we forgot the broadest idea of who we are. 
We forgot that we are humans and we forgot we are not humanly cultured. 
We are denying human culture.

While embracing the idea of being in a group and doing the best you can possibly do the betterment of your group,
You have to treat others as equals. Your brothers and your sisters. 
Infact, you have to treat them better than you treat yourselves coz they are your guests. 
You show your culture through your action.
Only then it will stop.

It's because you forgot.
You forgot that you are human. So, you are acting out of human culture.
What you can do is to pledge that you are human. All fellow human beings, your family.
You tell yourself that you will advocate the same to your children.
The solution to this problem is changing our habits.
We may or maynot see the complete cure in our life time but we can prevent our kids from forgetting the fact that they 
are human and assure that we bring them up reminding them they are human while we work on our cure.


The idea of groupism is a wonderful tool for development.
When the world 

it is chiefly pride that prevents men from agreeing to one another in matters of faith.
A blind man will say I can't see the sun. An blind and ignorant will say the sun didnot exist.
We are neither blind nor ignorant.
It is pride that cause error.


Today, I want to share with you a story. 
This is the story of a planet called earth.
Earth is one of the nine planets revolving round the sun, which is one of the four trillion stars 
present in the milkyway galaxy. 
Like our solar system, each star can possibly have a planetory system. 
There are about 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe. We don't know if there are universes like our universe 
in the outer space.

We live for 60 - 80 years on an average. We still don't know who we are. Where we come from and where we go after we die.
The science around us is only capable of giving us the answers and applications to questions that came from observable nature.
Isn't it stupidity to identify yourself with a group ?



What is causing people to kill other people ?
Groupism - social stratification or categorization

Education and Economic inequality

How can we end terrorism ?
Why is war not the solution ?
If war is a solution to this problem, there shouldn't be multiple wars.
We have to embrace the idea of oneness. Only then, we see others as our brothers and sisters.


What can we do to help ?
