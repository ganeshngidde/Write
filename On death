Amma is no more.
what is death ?
may be it's not the right question becuase I don't know what life is.
Sometimes I feel like there are whole lot of unimaginable things out there.

Where is she now ? Can I find her again ?
I want to find her.. I who ?
I is my brain here. Why I ?
I wants her company. 
The real I is not your brain. The real I is self. It wont' think.
It is just conscious. It is present.
