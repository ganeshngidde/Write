# Write

I want to write something.
What should I write about ? 
It is for me that I am writing. 
I will write my thoughts. How I am thinking at the time I write something.
It's like keeping a journal. Everyday, I sit to write something. 
Generally starting with some events happened recently, my reflections on those events and stuff like that.
