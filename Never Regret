It's a story about people and connection between them.
People are not here forever. There connections last.
We are so caught up with work and neglect people.
So, it is a reminder for every one of us to go, give and gratitude.
You'll never regret.

It's about connections that we make. Be it a parent, a friend or a wellwisher fo us.
Call them, meet them and talk to them your heart out. You'll never regret.
